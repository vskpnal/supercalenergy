      <h2>Permissions Used (Android / iOS)</h2>
      <p class="small">Permissions are requested at runtime with clear explanations and only when the feature is enabled by the user.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Activity Recognition</strong> (Android: <code>android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION</code>; iOS: motion APIs) — to detect physical activities for exercise detection and calorie adjustments.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera / Photo Library</strong> — to take or select photos for food scanning. Photos are processed locally and uploaded only if cloud sync is enabled.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage / Files access</strong> — to read images you choose to upload and to cache processed results.</li>
        <li><strong>POST_NOTIFICATIONS / Notification permission</strong> — to send meal, hydration, and goal reminders.</li>
        <li><strong>Internet / Network access</strong> — to access cloud sync, authentication, and optional online AI features.</li>

    <!-- Inserted Permissions: Health & Activity -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Health & Activity Permissions (Google Fit / Health Connect / Device Sensors)</h2>

      <h3>Active Calories — Read Access</h3>
      <p><strong>Short Play Store declaration:</strong><br>
      Used to read active calories burned from the device's health provider (Health Connect / Google Fit) to adjust daily calorie budget and analytics. Requested only with explicit user consent.</p>

      <p><strong>Detailed explanation:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Reading active calories allows the app to:
          <ul>
            <li>Adjust the user's daily calorie allowance in real time;</li>
            <li>Improve accuracy of calorie/energy balance calculations and analytics;</li>
            <li>Show burned-calorie data in activity summaries and trends.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Source & data collected:</strong> numeric active-calories values, timestamps, and source/provider metadata. The app reads existing records and does not write or modify other health data unless you explicitly enable write/sync features.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent & runtime request:</strong> Requested at runtime with a clear explanation. The feature is optional — core logging works if denied.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage & sharing:</strong> Data stored locally. Uploaded to cloud only if the user enables cloud backup/sync. Not sold; only shared in aggregated/anonymized form if opted into analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Background usage:</strong> Reads occur during active sync or when background sync is enabled by the user; otherwise reads occur while the app is in use or during an explicit sync action.</li>
        <li><strong>User controls:</strong> Revoke via device Settings → Apps → [This App] → Permissions, or disable health sync inside app settings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Activity Recognition Permission</h3>
      <p><strong>Short Play Store declaration:</strong><br>
      Used to detect user physical activity (walking, running, cycling) to adjust calorie estimates and enable automatic exercise logging. Requested only with user consent.</p>

      <p><strong>Detailed explanation:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Infers activity types and timestamps so the app can:
          <ul>
            <li>Adjust daily calorie allowance based on detected activity;</li>
            <li>Automatically detect and log exercise sessions;</li>
            <li>Improve step/activity-based summaries and recommendations.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Data collected:</strong> activity labels (still, walking, running, cycling), timestamps, and confidence scores. <strong>No GPS/location data</strong> is collected for activity recognition unless you separately enable location features.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage & sharing:</strong> Data stored locally; uploaded only if you enable cloud sync. Not sold; only shared in aggregated/anonymized form if you opt into analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent & runtime request:</strong> Requested at runtime with a clear in-app explanation. Optional — core features work if denied.</li>
        <li><strong>Background usage:</strong> Runs in background only if you enable continuous tracking; otherwise runs only while app is active or during a tracking session.</li>
        <li><strong>User controls:</strong> Revoke via device Settings → Apps → [This App] → Permissions, or disable activity tracking inside app settings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step Count — Read Access</h3>
      <p><strong>Short Play Store declaration:</strong><br>
      Used to read step count from the device’s health provider (Health Connect / Google Fit) to update activity summaries and adjust calorie/movement estimates. Requested only with explicit user consent.</p>

      <p><strong>Detailed explanation:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Reading step data allows the app to:
          <ul>
            <li>Show daily/weekly step totals and trends;</li>
            <li>Incorporate steps into activity summaries and calorie adjustments;</li>
            <li>Improve personalized suggestions and goal tracking.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Source & data collected:</strong> numeric step counts, timestamps, and provider metadata from Health Connect / Google Fit. The app reads existing records and does not write or modify other health data unless you enable sync/write features.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent & runtime request:</strong> Requested at runtime with a clear explanation. Optional — core logging remains available if denied.</li>
        <li><strong>Background usage:</strong> Reads occur during sync or when background sync is enabled; otherwise reads occur while app is in use or during explicit sync.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage & sharing:</strong> Stored locally; uploaded only if cloud sync is enabled. Not shared/sold except in aggregated/anonymized form with user consent.</li>
        <li><strong>User controls:</strong> Revoke via device Settings → Apps → [This App] → Permissions, or disable step sync inside app settings.</li>
